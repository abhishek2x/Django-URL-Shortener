Hi Dear,

Hope you are safe and fine

Thanks for applying to the Product Developer - Intern position at SurveySparrow.

As the first phase of the selection process, we would like you to do an assignment.

Develop a mock of bit.ly (https://bitly.com/).

Bitly is an application to help you with the short URLs.

Let's say you have a URL. You need to send that URL in an SMS. You will be having a character limit for SMS. So it would be nice to shorten your URL to something smaller.

URL: https://surveysparrow.com/features/create-a-survey/
Shortened URL: https://bit.ly/34uqMpV

Requirements are,
1. Develop an ability to shorten URL.


Nice to have,
1. User should be able to login to his account
2. Users can generate multiple short URLs.
3. Once the user logs in, he should be able to see the list of short URLs he has generated.

Must do,
1. Push your code to a repository in Github.
2. Host your application somewhere(Heroku, Netlify or something that you know) and then it should be accessible through the browser by a URL.


Once you have finished your application, with the Github repo URL and your application URL send us an email to divya@surveysparrow.com, cmb@surveysparrow.com.

The assignment should be submitted before 20th August 2020.

Happy Coding!
